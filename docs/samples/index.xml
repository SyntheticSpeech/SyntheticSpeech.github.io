      <description>XTTS vs. VALL-E-X # We present the results of our work below, categorized based on the models we ran and the different vocal features we were testing for.
Custom Voice Input # Input voice: XTTS VALL-E-X Voice with Emotion # These samples demonstrate how XTTS and VALL-E X retain the emotion of the input voice.
Input voice (Emotion: Amused): XTTS VALL-E-X Input voice (Emotion: Anger): XTTS VALL-E-X Input voice (Emotion: Disgust): XTTS VALL-E-X Voice with Environmental Noise and Textures # These samples demonstrate how XTTS and VALL-E X handle voice inputs that have an environment or texture that causes the voice to sound like it has a filter.</description>
