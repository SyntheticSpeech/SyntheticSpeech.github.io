      <description>Zero-Shot TTS # The next leap made for the generation of deepfaked audios is zero-shot TTSes. Zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) refers to the capability of a system to generate speech in a target voice without any specific training on that particular voice. In a traditional TTS system, training involves using a large dataset of recordings from a specific speaker to learn the characteristics of that speaker&amp;rsquo;s voice. In contrast, zero-shot TTS aims to generate speech in a new, unseen voice without requiring explicit training on that voice.</description>

      <description>VALL-E # VALL-E is a neural codec language model for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis that can generate high-quality speech that is indistinguishable from human speech. It is trained on a massive dataset of text and audio, and can also clone speakers&amp;rsquo; voices, even from a short sample of their speech. VALL-E works by first converting text into a sequence of discrete codes. These codes are then used to generate a corresponding sequence of audio tokens.</description>
