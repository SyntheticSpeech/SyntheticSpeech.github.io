The generation of deepfakes for both benign and nefarious purposes has only become more accessible through apps like FakeApp, Synthesia, Deepfakesweb.com and more. As a result, research into deepfakes has surged, driven by the need to understand, detect, and mitigate the potential threats they pose.\nSeveral key factors drive increased interest in deepfakes research:\nAdvancements in AI and Deep Learning: Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and deep learning have made it easier to create highly convincing deepfakes, necessitating a parallel advancement in detection and prevention methods. High-Profile Incidents: Deepfake-related incidents involving public figures and politicians have heightened awareness about their potential for malicious use, prompting more researchers to address these concerns. Privacy Concerns: As deepfake technology can be misused to create non-consensual explicit content or deceive individuals, privacy advocates have called for more research and legislation to combat these issues. National Security: Governments and security agencies have recognized the potential threat deepfakes pose to national security and infrastructure, leading to increased funding for research efforts to develop countermeasures. The landscape for deepfake research is expanding, taking root in disciplines outside of pure information and computer science:\nMitigation strategies for the proliferation of deepfakes requires a potentially interdisciplinary approach, seeing that it bleeds into every facet of society:\nDetection and Authentication: Researchers are developing tools and algorithms to identify deepfake content, often based on discrepancies in facial movements, blinking patterns, or audio inconsistencies. Policy and Legislation: Scholars are investigating the legal and ethical implications of deepfakes and advocating for regulations to prevent their misuse. Media Literacy and Enhanced Communication Skills: Efforts are underway to educate the public about deepfakes and provide tools for recognizing them, enhancing digital literacy. Erosion in public trust of important news sources and previously established language and communication rules is extremely detrimental, and deepfakes only exacerbate the issue. Countermeasures: Technological countermeasures, such as watermarking and authentication techniques, are being developed to hinder the creation and distribution of malicious deepfake content. Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration: Researchers from fields as diverse as computer science, psychology, and ethics are joining forces to address the multifaceted challenges posed by deepfakes. The rise of deepfake technology has prompted a commensurate increase in research, as the potential consequences of its misuse become more apparent. Deepfake research is essential to stay ahead of malicious uses and protect privacy, security, and societal trust. As this technology continues to advance, collaboration between academia, industry, and government will be vital in our ongoing battle against the deepfake phenomenon.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/samples/fine-tune-vallex/","title":"Fine-tuned VALL-E X","section":"Samples","content":" Fine-tuned VALL-E X # Input sample Output sample "},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/samples/fine-tune-yourtts/","title":"Fine-tuned yourTTS","section":"Samples","content":" Fine-tuned yourTTS # Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain good results with this model at all.

It is the first end-to-end model compared to the previous 2-stage model\u0026ndash; this means that there is no need to produce intermediate mel-spectrums.\nOur fine-tuning code is based on this repo.\nThe repo has a pretrained model on VCTK using some animes. It can be used for fine-tuning Chinese, Japanese and English.\nWe self recorded a small collection of voices, and tried to fine-tune the pretrained VITS model based on this dataset. Besides, we also tried using public datasets like LibriSpeech, and publicly acquired voice samples like Anne Hathaway\u0026rsquo;s voice. Our experiment records are provided below.\nDataset Epoch Result* Note Hao\u0026rsquo;s self collected voices (19 Samples) 20 Tune close, pronounciation fail n/a Hao\u0026rsquo;s self collected voices (41 Samples) 25 No improvement n/a Anne Hathaway, 12 mins audio 20 Tune close, pronounciation better, not perfect n/a Hao\u0026rsquo;s self collected voices (15 mins audio, Chinese) 50 Tune close, still strange pronouns, but better than EN n/a LibriSpeech(Speaker 3572, 103 samples) 50 Pretty steady n/a *Since the performance of synthetic audios are usually evaluated by humans (like MOS), the result column records our experience with the output audio.\nWe found that the quality of the fine-tuned model is highly dependent on the number of data samples. A successfully fine-tuned model needs hours and hours of audio samples.\nYourTTS # A newer ZS-TTS model based on VITS, proposed by Coqui. It is also multi-lingual. We implemented our fine-tuning based on the open-source code released by Coqui.\nDataset Epoch Result Note Hao\u0026rsquo;s self collected voices (19 Samples) 20 fail, voice not clearly formed n/a Hao\u0026rsquo;s self collected voices (19 Samples) 160 fail, voice not clearly formed n/a We did not dig deeper into the training, as we found the VALL-E model later on and shifted our priorities to the VALL-E model.\nVALL-E # Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s new SOTA ZS-TTS model that proposes a different way to perform synthetic audio generation. It tokenizes the audio prompt and text prompt into a T * 8 matrix, and then feeds them into an Auto-regressive model and a Non-autogressive model.\nFor each model, the basic strcuture contains several embedding layers, and a Transformer Decoder layer.\nSince Microsoft has not published VALL-E\u0026rsquo;s code, we tried several publicly avaiable implementations of Microsoft VALL-E, described in the following sections.\nenhuiz # This repo uses g2p (Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion) to quantize and tokenize the dataset. It also uses Deepspeed to speed up training.\nThe main issue with this method is that there is no pretrained model. So we tried to train a backbone model using LibriLight, and fine-tune the backbone model using a smaller, self-collected dataset.\nProbelms:\nTraining a sophisticated backbone model ourselves requires way more time and knowledge. LibriLight is too small (1200 samples) for the backbone model. Directly trained on self-collected dataset, gives poor results as expected. Ecker # Ecker\u0026rsquo;s code is based on enhuiz\u0026rsquo;s scripts, but the author released a pretrained model. So we thought we can conduct our fine-tuning based on the pretrained model.\nProblems:\nPretrained model has errors, it only gives NAN result in AR forward. We also checked on huggingface; the model does not seem to be working. Training based on the pretrained model has high loss. Lifeiteng # Lifeiteng\u0026rsquo;s implementation relies on Lhotse for its dataset preparation. Lhotse will process the audios into CutSet, and later a DynamicBucketSampler is used for constructing the dataloader.\nOne interesting bug we found is that we need to change our dataset to mono-channel, since Encodec uses 24KHZ mono-channel. If stereo inputs are given, we need to use 49KHZ Encodec model.\nNo pretrained model exists for Lifeiteng\u0026rsquo;s repo. We found someone who trained the model on LibriTTS for 100 epoches, and continued our fine-tuning based on their checkpoint.\nProblem:\nThe checkpoint\u0026rsquo;s performance is very bad. On AWS, we encountered a complex versioning problem because of torch, nnCUDA, K2 and python. Seems no easy workable solution can be found. Plachtaa # Checkout our fine-tuning branch.\nPlachtaa uses Lifeiteng\u0026rsquo;s repo, and has a very well-trained pretrained model. The only problem is that Plachtaa deleted all training related scripts, like dataset processing, training script and even the model\u0026rsquo;s forward passes.\nThere are differences between Plachtaa and Lifeiteng\u0026rsquo;s implementation: Plachtaa supports multi-lingual features by adding language embedding, uses different tokenizer and is trained on a different dataset.\nWe tried to rewrite all these missing training scripts, and ran our fine-tuning. The following sections summarize our experiments. We are still facing inference issues as the generated audio is mainly noise.\nImplementation details # As lifeiteng uses Lhotse, we have to make our dataset something like libriTTS. We also need to use its CutSet as dataset class, and its Sampler when constructing dataloader.\nLifeiteng and Plachtaa uses a different tokenizer, resulting in a difference in TextTokenCollator\nLifeiteng Tokenize logic: text_prompt -\u0026gt; tokenizer (espeak) -\u0026gt; phonemes -\u0026gt; Collator (using precomputed SymbolTable) -\u0026gt; index sequence\nPlachtaa Tokenize logic: text_prompt -\u0026gt; Add language ID -\u0026gt; tokenizer (PhonemeBpeTokenizer, with pre-defined index mapping) -\u0026gt; index sequence directly, Collator just need to perform EOS/DOS/PAD\nThe most important thing to notice is that Plachtaa added language ID to text prompt:\ntext = \u0026#34;[EN]\u0026#34; + text + \u0026#34;[EN]\u0026#34; Besides, phoneme index mapping is different. For example, PAD in PhonemeBpeTokenizer is 3, but in Lifeiteng\u0026rsquo;s Tokenizer is 0.\nIn the model\u0026rsquo;s forward pass, we added the language embedding calculation accordingly.\nFirst run # Successfully trained on Plachtaa\u0026rsquo;s pretrained model, using Lifeiteng\u0026rsquo;s training code.

It is trained on a massive dataset of text and audio, and can also clone speakers\u0026rsquo; voices, even from a short sample of their speech. VALL-E works by first converting text into a sequence of discrete codes. These codes are then used to generate a corresponding sequence of audio tokens. The audio tokens are then decoded into a waveform using a neural audio codec model.\nKey features # Uses a language modeling approach and applies it to TTS. Train a neural codec language model using discrete codes derived from an off-the-shelf neural audio codec model, and regard TTS as a conditional language modeling task rather than continuous signal regression. The model takes in text prompts as phonemes and a 3-second recording sample from the target speaker. The model then generates the corresponding acoustic tokens conditioned on the acoustic tokens of the 3-second recording and the phoneme prompt. Finally, the generated acoustic tokens are used to synthesize the final waveform with corresponding neural codec decoder. Ultimately, VALL-E generates synthetic, natural-sounding speech with high degree of similarity to the speaker with zero-shot prompting, outperforming YourTTS on LibriSpeech and VCTK.\nVALL-E X # VALL-E X is an extension of VALL-E that enables cross-lingual text-to-speech synthesis and speech-to-speech translation. It is trained on a multilingual dataset of text and audio, and can synthesize speech in a target language from a text prompt in the source language, while preserving the speaker\u0026rsquo;s voice, emotion, and acoustic environment.YourTTSYourTTS is a zero-shot multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) model that can generate realistic and engaging speech for a wide range of applications, even without having to train it on a large amount of data. It achieves this by using a number of modifications to the VITS TTS model, including external speaker embeddings, a multilingual training dataset, and joint training of the speaker encoder and decoder.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/docs/related_work/","title":"Related Work","section":"Docs","content":" The Evolution of Text-to-Speech and Voice Cloning # Overview # Text-to-speech is a surprisingly ancient fascination; scientists as early as 1779 were building models to emulate the human voice. The 30s saw the developmemt of vocoders, which used electronic synthesizers to reproduce human speech in limited capacity. Development on TTS technology remained within the realm of computational and mathematical techniques for speech synthesis until the emergence of deep-learning based technqiues, which improved the quality and naturalness of synthesized voices dramtically. Deepfaked audios, as part of this evolution, have thus developed as a result of advancements in deep neural networks and related techniques.\nWe summarize below the most popular deepfake tools:\nTool Key Features Lyrebird • Fast • Can produce 1000 sentences per second Char2Wave End-to-end model with 2 components: reader and neural vocoder. Reader is an encoder-decoder model with attention. WaveNet Based on PixleCNN Deep Voice 3 Has 3 components: encoder, decoder, convertor VITS Parallel end-to-end TTS method that generates more natural sounding audio than current two-stage models YourTTS • Based on VITS model • Supports multi-speaker, multilingual speech NeMo State-of-the-art neural TTS where both cascaded and end-to-end (upcoming) systems are included Text-to-Speech: Basic Mechanism # Step 1: Phenomizer\nPhonemizer transforms text into phonemes. Phonemes are a textual representation of the pronunciation of words (for example — the word tomato will have different phonemes in an American and British accent), and this representation helps the downstream model achieve better results. No machine learning occurs here. Step 2: Acoustic Features\nAn acoustic model transforms phonemes into a Mel spectrogram. Mel Spectrogram is a representation of audio in the time X frequency domain. A spectrogram is achieved by applying a short Fourier transform (STFT) on overlapping time windows of a raw audio waveform. Typically, a trained model is used to generate acoustic features from input text; these features represent the spectral characteristics of speech and include information about the fundamental frequency (F0), spectral envelope, and duration. Many advanced pieces of information are captured here, like intonation, rhythm and stress patterns, and depending on what information is captured by the model, it can be possible to handle speaker variability. Step 3: Vocoder Model / Waveform Synthesis\nThe Mel Spectrogram is converted into a waveform Waveform is sampled at 24/48 kHz, where each sample is digitized into a 16-bit number. These numbers represent the amount of air pressure at each moment in time, which is the sound we eventually hear in our ears.
